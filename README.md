 Bosun Tin Shin website

This is the code for the website Bosun Tin Shin, a project commissioned by Matt Watson, made solely by Mykhaylo Levchenko aka Mikhail Leon.
The back-end cannot be fully implemented at this time (the plan was to let Netlify host, with a custom domain) as it requires a custom connection to PayPal and Printful to fulfill orders & payments. Matt currently has not created a PayPal nor acquired the desired domain in addition to other requirements.
