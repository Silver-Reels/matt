Visit https://silverreels.netlify.app/bosun-tin-shin-design-document.pdf for the design document on Bosun Tin Shin.

This is the code for the website Bosun Tin Shin, a project commissioned by Matt Watson, made solely by Mykhaylo Levchenko aka Mikhail Leon.

For more information, visit my portfolio's section on Bosun Tin Shin: https://silverreels.netlify.app/bosun which contains a short showcase video of the website.

The project is written in vanilla JS and CSS as a single-page-application.

The back-end cannot be fully implemented at this time (the plan was to let Netlify host, with a custom domain) as it requires a custom connection to PayPal and Printful to fulfill orders & payments - the work on which cannot begin as Matt currently has not created a PayPal nor acquired the desired domain in addition to other requirements. Nonetheless I am proud of this project and see no reason to keep it off Github.

The copyrighted photography belonging to Matt is not provided in this repository. It could perhaps be hosted separately on a database or also with Netlify.
